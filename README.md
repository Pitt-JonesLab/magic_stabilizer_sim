# magic_stabilizer_sim

What is stabilizer rank of GATE (e.g. sqiswap) but primarily care about non-CX gates that appear directly in algorithms?

What is robustness of magic of GATE?

Does the current decomp have room for improvement according to the robustness?

"Two methods are known for producing [stabilizer] decompositions. The first method relies onconstructing an equivalent circuit to U in which every non-Clifford gate is replaced by a Clifford gate and an ancilla qubit initialized in a magic state. This is the same state-injection gadget from fault-tolerant quantum computing, where non-Clifford gates are applied byconsuming ancilla qubits prepared using some magic state distillation routine [30]. The upshot is that this method allows us to convert compressed stabilizer decompositions of copies of a magic state into stabilizer decompositions of the output state of the circuit. The second method, known as the sum-over-Cliffords method, is more direct, but produces only approximate stabilizer decompositions. It relies on decomposing each nonClifford gate in the circuit as a linear combination of Cliffords and then using randomizedsparsification to find a sparse approximation. Below we give a more detailed descriptionof the two methods." - https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/16814/Qassim_Hammam.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y

"gadgets are useful is that they allow to effectively implement a gate from the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy using a special resource state and gates from the (kâˆ’1)-th level only"
